From the assembly, we acquire the following information:
- a_struct[CNT] is 288 bytes in size
- a_struct is 40 bytes in size
- idx is the first member of a_struct and is a long
- x is the second member of a_struct and is a long[]

Therefore, we can form the conclusion that CNT is 7, while a_struct definition is as follows:
```
typedef struct {
    long idx;
    long x[4];
} a_struct;
```
